      <p>
        There are two parts of your project submission:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>your Racing Buggy Editor web application</li>
        <li>a "{{ report_type }}" summarising your work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because you have developed a webserver, for the
        {{ config['PROJECT_CODE'] }} Racing Buggy project
        your {{ report_type }} is — of course — a page on your webserver at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://localhost:5000/poster">http://localhost:5000/{{ report_type }}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-is-in-your-{{ report_type }}">
        What is {% if report_type == "poster" %} on {% else %} in {% endif %}
        your {{ report_type }}?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are two parts: the top and the bottom (of the single web page):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>top</strong>: "sell" the features of your editor</li>
        <li><strong>bottom</strong>: notes on each task you attempted</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-is-on-the-top-of-your-{{ report_type }}">What is on the top of your {{ report_type }}?</h2>
      <p>
        You've made a working (up to a point) buggy editor! Tell someone who
        lands on this page what's great about it! What does it offer? What can
        you do with it? What features does it have? Use CSS, use images if you
        want, but think about the information you're presenting too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are examples of webpages that do this for <em>their</em> editors:
        this is only for inspiration, you can make it your own!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>:
          our main code editor for this module 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a>:
          a Windows text editor
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://macromates.com">TextMate</a>:
          a Mac editor
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>:
          the Atom text editor
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Obviously some of those have the power of a team of pro graphic
        designers behind them so it's OK if yours isn't a complete festival
        for the eyes... but once you've been working on your buggy editor
        for a little while, you'll know enough about HTML to know how
        to organise headings and paragraphs or maybe bullet lists or...
        well, see how you get on with HTML and style.
      </p>
      <p>
        (But don't forget this is about conveying the <em>features</em> your
        editor has).
      </p>

      <p>
        Underneath that we want to see a list of the tasks your attempted with
        a couple of sentences on each: what you did and anything you did and
        didn't do. This is where we can give you credit for your
        <em>understanding</em> even if you didn't manage to get all of the task
        working.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>
      <p>
        As you'll know by the time you set this up, there is more than one way
        to do this, but you are <em>strongly recommended</em> to add your
        poster like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        In <code>app.py</code> add another route (drop it in with your other
        routes, which means somewhere <em>before</em> <code>app.run()</code>
        is called):
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <pre class="border border-secondary p-3">
@app.route('/{{ report_type }}')
def {{ report_type }}():
  return render_template('{{ report_type }}.html')
</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p>
        Incidentally this makes sense to you because you know how Flask
        webservers work now. How cool is that? Well done!
      </p>
      <p>
        And in <code>templates/{{ report_type }}.html</code> add this: (maybe
        copy-and-paste it?) (we've written the first one — <code>0-GET</code>
        for you as an example — of course you can edit it!)
      </p>

    I forked the repo on GitHub and then used &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; to make
    a local copy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to
    version control as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo
    at the end of each day. I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a
    SSH key so I didn't need to enter username and password every time I
    pushed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- this closes the section: keep it in! --&gt;

        We'll be looking at the code to see <em>what</em> you did, but in the
        notes just drop a short paragraph saying <em>what you did</em>. And
        what was tricky or anything you learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're looking for opportunities to give you credit for having
        <em>understood</em> what you were doing. That's why it's OK if you
        didn't do a task completely: tell us why.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, for 1-VALID the different <em>types</em> of data are not
        equally easy to validate. "I did not validate the <code>xyz</code>
        field in the same way as <code>qty_wheels</code> because&#8230;". You
        need to show us you understood what you did (and learned from it) so
        sometimes that includes explaining the bits you didn't do, and why.
        Doing is better than not doing, obviously: but if you couldn't
        do a complete task you can still get some credit for it if it's clear
        you dived into it.

        <p>
          You can make notes as you go along, and download them as text or
          already in HTML format (see below) to put into your report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this is not your report! It's simply a convenient place
          to collect your notes as you go along. You still have to manage putting
          it into the <code>/{{ report_type }}</code> page of your buggy editor.
          However, there are buttons for <strong>downloading your notes</strong>
          which will already put them in a helpful HTML format, if you want.
