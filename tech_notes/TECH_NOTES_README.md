Tech notes were originally prepared for Jekyll and served via GitHub pages.
They're now hosted by (this) race server by default, using Pelican to generate
the pages (because it's a Python static site generator, avoiding the dependency
on Ruby).

However, if you set the config variable TECH_NOTES_EXTERNAL_URL you can host
your customised tech notes there â€” in which case, using Jekyll on GitHub
pages is a good solution. If you need it, below is an example of the original
(for Jekyll) _config.yml file that the previous version of the pages used:
