# CS1999 project details

The project requires you to work on a racing buggy editor: it's a Python
Flask webserver you've been given, and which you develop in phases through a 
series of tasks.

The "poster" sells your editor and summarises your journey through those
tasks.

See the task list for details of how and what you need to do.

## Development workflow

This is a practical project. Here is a breakdown of _how_ you should be working

## Submission deadline

<del>The submission for your project is due on</del>

<p style="background-color:#640000;color:white;padding:1em;border:2px solid red;">
    <em>TBC</em>
</p>


That's the submission we'll be assessing (and running) to see how you got on
with your Python and webserver skills.

> Note that your poster is part of your project so you've only got one
> submission (the zip file) and one submission date. 
> _This may be different for non-CompSci students (i.e., Maths, EE, or Physics)_
> _doing FY1999 projects: they have two submissions on two different dates._

You can submit your project before the deadline. Don't leave it until the
very last minute. In the Computer Science department, we know (which means:
_you_ know) that IT systems sometimes go down, disks fail, and chumps spill
coffee over laptops. Build contingency into your planning so if this happens
to you it's merely a problem and not a disaster.

## How to submit

Submission is on the Moodle: follow the instructions on the 
[CS1999 Moodle page]({{ site.moodle_url }})...
but make a zip (with your last name as the zip filename). For example, when
Jane Holloway submits her project, she submits a file called `holloway.zip`.

Just zip up your webserver and submit that (it'll look a lot like your repo did
when you cloned it).

> Please do **not** include the `venv` or `__pycache__` directories (if you have
> them) because they might be huge and we don't need it in the zip. We don't
> need the `.git` directory either. But don't worry if theses files get in
> anyway, we'll cope.
