# Default tasks in these task files

File `tasks.md` contains the text for all the tasks _except_ the first
two (0-GET and 0-RUN) because these depend on the method of distribution
used to get the buggy editor source code to each student.

The first two tasks - 0-GET and 0-RUN â€” depend on the config settings of the
distribution method, and the names/keys of those are in
`buggy_race_server/admin/models.py` as `DistribMethods`.
The default is "zip".

See the docs on
[Buggy editor: distributing the code](http://localhost:4000/docs/buggy-editor/distributing-the-code).
