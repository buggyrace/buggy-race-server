> This is the "buggy editor" component of the {% if project_code %}{{ project_code }} {% endif %}Buggy Racing project.


Overview
--------

This is the skeleton of an application for editing a racing buggy.

It runs as a webserver so you can edit the configuration of a buggy in your
browser. The editor can then generate the data, in JSON format, that you need
in order to enter races on the [race server]({{ buggy_race_server_url }}).

The application is written in Python3 using the
[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) micro-framework.

> It's also written in a way which you can and should improve! You should be
> able to get it up and running (with SQLite) without needing to change the
> code... but from that point on you'll need to change pretty much everything
> to make it better.

Installation & set-up
---------------------

{% if task_0_get_name -%}
**The first task is [{{ task_0_get_name }}: get the source code]({{ buggy_race_server_url }}{{ url_for('public.show_single_task', task_id=task_0_get_name) }})**
{%- endif %}

> If you don't have access to your own machine, it's possible to use online
> platforms like [repli.it](https://replit.com) or
> [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) instead.

You must have [Python]((https://www.python.org)) installed (at least version 3.9).

If you're not already in the project's directory, `cd` into it.

Install the Python modules: 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database by running the `init_db.py` script (this creates an SQLite
database in a file called `database.db`):

    python3 init_db.py

That's it. You're ready to go!


Running the server
------------------

Run the buggy editor application with:

    python3 app.py

{% if editor_port %}Unless you change it, the webserver is running on port {{ editor_port }}. {% endif %}
If you make a request for a web page, it will respond with one!

Go to [http://{{ editor_host }}{{ editor_port_with_colon }}](http://{{ editor_host }}{{ editor_port_with_colon }}) in your web browser.
You haven't specified a path, so you'll get the `/` route, which uses the
uses the `index.html` template (you can see this by looking in `app.py`).

You can see the webserver's activity in the terminal, and the result of its
action in the browser.


### Shutting down the server

When you want to stop the program, in the terminal where the webserver is
running, press Control-C. This interrupts the server and halts the execution of
the program. (If you go to [http://{{ editor_host }}{{ editor_port_with_colon }}](http://{{ editor_host }}{{ editor_port_with_colon }}) in
your web browser now, you'll see a message saying you can't connect to the
server â€” because you've killed it: it's no longer there).


### Extra detail: setting `FLASK_ENV`

It's best if you run in Flask's _development environment_. To do that, set the 
environment variable `FLASK_ENV` before you run `appy.py` to `development`.
Once you've done this, it's good for the rest of the session.

On Windows cmd/Powershell do:

    $env:FLASK_ENV = 'development'

On Linux or Mac:

    export FLASK_ENV=development
