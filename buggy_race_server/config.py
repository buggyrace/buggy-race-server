"""Application configuration.

Most configuration is set via environment variables.

Create a .env file (by copying env.example and editing it)
or load environment variables in your own way

This class gathers them and potentially modifies them
(e.g., env vars must be strings, but via this mechanism
you can wash or cast type (e.g., admin usernames as a list))

When the app loads: needs a DB connection (ENV var or other config?)
but everything else from the settings in the database:
  stored as set of name-value pairs
