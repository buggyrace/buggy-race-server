   Task list HTML is generated by admin, so markdown parsing only happens once
   (we don't expect task list to change materially during the lifetime of the
   project, once's it's started).
   The partial _tasks.html contains the rendered HTML which includes any
   config substitutions that applied at the time it was generated.
   It's in a template here for that current announcements/flash messages
   are rendered too.
